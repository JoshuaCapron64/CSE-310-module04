# Overview
This software is created as a tutorial for those who wish to learn and see in action various basic aspects and applications of the C# programming language. As someone who has never programmed in C# before, I hope to use this opportunity to learn and practice these basics myself, especially considering how much more commonplace and influentiual the C# language has become in recent years.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Visual Studio Code along with the C# extension released by Microsoft, the C# Essentials extension released by Felix Schr√∂ter, and the scriptcsRunner extention released by Filip W. I also had to install scriptcs directly onto my machine, since the debugger would recognize C# .cs files as scriptcs compatible by default. Only the C# language was necessary to develop this software.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Further research Unions, and see if they can be implemented in C# despite little documentation, and no evidence on an existing data type in the language.
- Make more clear the differences bewteen Classes and Structures by creating more Classes and Structures.
- Perhaps create an alternate version that relies on different means to utilize the C# language in Visual Studio Code. I am told that they exist, and that they may be more reliable than the work I had to do to obtain scriptcs.
